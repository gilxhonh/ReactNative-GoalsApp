# Daily Goals App

It's a simple React Native app which allows you to track your goals.

In this app, we got a list of goals and we can open a model and overly to add new goals.

And once a goal was added, we can also tap the goal to remove it.

It's a great first app to learn about many core fundamentals about React Native.
